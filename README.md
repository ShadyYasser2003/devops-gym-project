# **GYM Management System Documentation Using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, Gitea, SonarQube, Trivy, ArgoCD, and EC2**

## 1. **Introduction**

This project is a **web-based GYM management application**. It is designed to streamline gym membership management, class schedules, and progress tracking. The project uses modern **DevOps** practices and integrates various tools to ensure seamless **continuous integration (CI)**, **continuous deployment (CD)**, and **security scanning**. The system also ensures code quality through static analysis and manages vulnerability checks for Docker images.

### **Project Objectives:**
- Build a fully integrated DevOps pipeline for continuous delivery.
- Perform **static code analysis** using **SonarQube** to ensure code quality.
- Implement continuous deployment using **Jenkins** and **ArgoCD**.
- Perform **vulnerability scanning** on Docker images using **Trivy**.
- Deploy the application on **Kubernetes** and **EC2**.

## 2. **Tools and Technologies**

The following tools and technologies were used in this project:

- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the GYM application, ensuring that it runs in isolated, consistent environments.
  
- **Kubernetes**: Used for orchestrating and managing the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of Docker containers in a cloud environment.
  
- **Jenkins**: Automates the build, test, and deployment pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
  
- **Git** and **Gitea**: Version control is handled by Git, and Gitea is used as the Git repository manager for the source code.

- **SonarQube**: A tool for static code analysis that helps maintain code quality by identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

- **Trivy**: A Docker image vulnerability scanner used to identify potential security risks in Docker images before deployment.

- **ArgoCD**: Manages continuous delivery to Kubernetes clusters, providing automated deployment workflows.

- **EC2**: Used for manual deployment of the application to a virtual server for testing and running the application in a production-like environment.

## 3. **Environment Setup**

### **Local Environment Setup:**

1. **Docker**:
   - Install Docker on your local machine.
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to define how to build and run your GYM application inside a container.

2. **Kubernetes**:
   - Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using **Minikube** or use cloud-based Kubernetes services like **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** or **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**.

3. **Jenkins**:
   - Install Jenkins and configure it to manage your CI/CD pipeline.
   - Install required tools like **Node.js**, **SonarQube**, and integrate them with Jenkins.

4. **Gitea**:
   - Host your source code in a **Gitea** repository.
   - Set up webhooks in Gitea to trigger Jenkins jobs when code is pushed to the repository.

### **EC2 Deployment Setup:**

1. **Set up EC2 Instances**:
   - Deploy the GYM application to an **EC2 instance** using **SSH** and **Docker**.
   - Create a Docker container on EC2 to run the application
